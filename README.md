# Read-Time-Face-Mask-Detecting-System

Read Time Face Mask Detecting System using OpenCV, Keras/TensorFlow, and Deep Learning.The Detection Model was inspired by the one made by Adrian Rosebrock at pyimagesearch.
Easily detects whether you are wearing a Face Mask or not. Highly Accurate results, but need some more fine tuning in detecting masked faces using OpenCV as the Data was artificially generated.
